        <h3>MArch, Year 4 Design Project, University of Greenwich</h3>
        
        <p>The Muisca people were one of the four high civilisations in South America that inhabited the high plateau
            Altiplano Cundiboyacense, located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes. Nowadays, they can be
            characterised as a Native American population that suffered a tremendous trauma: their sacred territory, which was at the
            centre of their belief system, was abused and subsequently destroyed.</p>
        
        <p>When the Spaniards arrived at the beginning of the sixteenth century, they secretly studied the spiritual aspect of the
            Muisca’s culture. The purpose behind it was to destroy the sacred connection between them and their land, to leave them
            unprotected to conquer and convert them to Christianity.</p>
        
        
        <p>Therefore, as these indigenous people have experienced centuries of discrimination, my project aims to act as a symbol
            of resistance. Moreover, the project will create the foundation for regaining their identity and reviving their spiritual
            connection with the land. Their legacy is deeply buried in their sacred land, interpreted by them as a lost paradise.</p>
        
       
        <p>The buildings, entitled The Sun and The Moon Temples, are a re-imagination of their most important temples. The Sun
            Temple, which was the dwelling place of their Sun God, Sue, will be used as the headquarters of the Great Council of the
            Muisca people. The Moon Temple, which was the dwelling place of their Moon Goddess Chia, will be used as their sacred
            indigenous college. Both of the temples have the purpose to revive the Muiscas’ cultural values, and to display in the
            public eye their collective memory.</p>
        
        <p>This project will be designed according to the Muisca’s belief system in order to perform their traditional ceremonies
            that are fundamental in re-establishing their cosmology while reintegrating their cultural identity into contemporary
            society.</p>
        
        <p>The architecture of this project desires to act as an eraser of the past centuries, not only to bring into the limelight the
            memory of the indigenous culture but moreover to revive their community.</p>
